## R5 - Purpose and Scope of the application
The Quiz App application I have created is a fun and easy for users to expand their knowledge through a series of multiple choice questions in an interactive way targeting any person who has an interest in learning about a particular topic.
<br>

On the first login to the Quiz App, the user will be able to create their own profile to individually identify themselves. A returning user will be able to be access their profile and a list of completed quizzes and scores will be displayed from previous quizzes.
<br>

The multiple choice questions will be set out into categories based on a particular topic (ie. Capital Cities). These categories are listed into a separate menu which is accessed off the main menu. Passing into the chosen quiz category, the user will be able to select from three different levels, Easy, Medium and Hard. Once a level has been selected they will be able to answer a series of questions in this category. The user is not restricted to starting at the easiest category however the menu follows a top to bottom layout to guide the user to the easiest category first.
<br>

After a quiz is completed, the user will be returned to the Quiz menu of the category they have selected from which they can choose to either take the next quiz on the list, or navigate to a different category via the menu options to complete a quiz in a different category. 
<br>

One feature the user will notice is the ability to access the stored scores menu directly from the Quiz menu. Whilst this can also be accessed from the Main Menu, this feature has been added to improve the functionality of the application to prevent the user from doubling back to the Main Menu
<br>

An Exit option, located in the main menu will allow the user to exit the Quiz App, with their completed quizzes and scores saved for their return.
<br>

## R6 - Three Features of the application
### Feature 1 - Menu
A series of menus have been created to help guide the user to all parts of the app. The menu options have been placed inside an array with a ''puts statement" guiding the user to select the option of their choice. 

Upon entry into the app, the user will be greeted with a message and main menu, from the main menu they will be able to create their profile, load an existing profile, go to the quiz area and scores area to list their scores.

### Feature 2 - Create Profile
The user will have the option to create their own profile based on a series of questions with have been encased in a method, this will help individually identify each user via the attributes that have been stored in a class

### Feature 3 - Loading Existing Profile 
Within the app, a future feature is to be creating to allow the user to access their existing profile including completed quizzes. This will retrieve the data stored in a separate YAML file. This can be done by a method of its own with access to the class of the members.
